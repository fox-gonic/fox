# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- Route manifest export helpers for generating a stable JSON snapshot of
  registered routes, including `RouteManifestFromEngine`, `WriteRouteManifest`,
  and the `fox.route-manifest/v1` manifest format.
- Manifest type metadata for closure handlers, covering input and result types
  while preserving route method, path, and original handler name.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-06

This release graduates the project from the `0.0.x` prototype track to the
`0.1.x` line. It bundles the 2026-05 audit results: a sweep of correctness
fixes, a small set of intentional breaking changes (each documented below
with a migration note), test coverage backfill across `examples/` and
`render/`, and Gin baseline benchmarks.

### Breaking Changes
- `IsValidHandlerFunc` no longer accepts `interface` as the second parameter
  type — handlers using `func(ctx, args any)` will now panic at registration.
  Use a concrete `struct` or `map` type instead.
- `logger.NewWithContext` no longer reads trace IDs from the
  `logger.TraceID` string context key. Propagate trace IDs with
  `logger.TraceIDKey` (the typed key) or via `logger.NewContext`.
- `*httperrors.Error` returned from `IsValid()` is no longer wrapped as
  `BIND_ERROR`. Consumers that matched on the `BIND_ERROR` response `code`
  to detect binding failures should use the HTTP 400 status code or their
  own specific codes instead.

### Added
- `examples/*/main_test.go` smoke tests for all examples.
- `render` package smoke test.
- Gin baseline benchmarks for performance comparison.

### Changed
- `httperrors.Error.MarshalJSON` no longer mutates its receiver and now
  flattens `Meta` when it is either a struct or a pointer to a struct (via
  `reflect.Indirect`). The method keeps a value receiver so that `Error` still
  marshals correctly when used as a value (for example in `[]Error` slices
  or `map[string]Error`).
- `bind` skips body reads only when `Content-Length == 0` **and** no transfer
  encoding is declared. Requests with unknown length (`Content-Length == -1`)
  or chunked encoding continue to read the body as before.
- `DefaultValidator` now reuses the package-level `Validate` instance, so
  custom validations registered via `fox.Validate.RegisterValidation(...)`
  are honored during binding.
- Documentation now uses the actual `httperrors.Error` fields and JSON response keys.
- Documentation now aligns Go version, security policy, performance reproduction notes, and release history.

### Fixed
- Package-level `logger.Debug`, `Info`, `Warn`, `Error`, `Fatal`, and `Panic` now spread variadic arguments correctly.
- `*httperrors.Error` returned from `IsValid()` (including values wrapped via
  `fmt.Errorf("%w", ...)`) is passed through without being wrapped as
  `BIND_ERROR`, preserving user-defined `Code` and `HTTPCode`. Detection uses
  `errors.As` so any error chain containing a `*httperrors.Error` is unwrapped.
- `IsValid()` is now called for pointer handler parameters after binding,
  covering value-receiver implementations on the addressable parameter.

### Deprecated
- `ErrInvalidHandlerType`; use `MsgInvalidHandlerType`. The alias will be
  removed in `v0.2.0`.

## [0.0.10] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- Added struct binding examples for URL and query parameters.
- Comprehensive unit tests for `logger` package (90.8% coverage)
- Comprehensive unit tests for `utils` package (100% coverage)
- CHANGELOG.md file for tracking project changes
- Added Codecov integration and expanded test coverage across core packages.

### Changed
- Upgraded the module and GitHub Actions toolchain to Go 1.25.
- Aligned Gin ecosystem dependencies with Gin upstream, including `github.com/gin-gonic/gin` v1.12.0 and `github.com/gin-contrib/cors` v1.7.7.
- Updated `github.com/rs/zerolog` to v1.35.1.
- Updated GitHub Actions dependencies, including `codecov/codecov-action` v6.

### Fixed
- Attached trace IDs to the request context in logger middleware.
- Renamed `reponse_time.go` to `response_time.go` (typo correction)

## [0.1.0-beta] - 2024-12-06

> Note: This pre-release entry is superseded by `[0.1.0]`. The interim
> `0.0.x` releases (see `[0.0.10]` above) carried incremental fixes; the
> `[0.1.0]` entry above marks the project's graduation to the `0.1.x` line.

### Added

- Support for multiple handler signatures:
  - `func()`
  - `func(ctx *Context) T`
  - `func(ctx *Context) (T, error)`
  - `func(ctx *Context, args S) T`
  - `func(ctx *Context, args S) (T, error)`
- Automatic parameter binding from JSON, Form, Query, URI, Header
- Context value binding with `context:"key"` tag
- Custom validator interface `IsValider`
- Automatic response rendering based on return types
- Structured HTTP error handling with `httperrors.Error`
- High-performance logging system based on zerolog
- TraceID/RequestID tracking support
- Multi-domain routing support with regex pattern matching
- X-Response-Time middleware for performance monitoring
- CORS configuration support

## Notes

**⚠️ Pre-1.0 Status**: This project is on the `0.1.x` line. The public API
is stabilizing but may still see breaking changes in subsequent minor
releases. Each breaking change is documented in this CHANGELOG with a
migration note. Production use is possible with the understanding that you
may need to adapt to breaking changes between minor versions until `v1.0.0`.

### Known Issues
- lumberjack dependency uses +incompatible version

### Upcoming Features
- Built-in security middleware (rate limiting, CSRF, request-size limits)
- Additional middleware for common use cases
- Improved documentation and examples
- Performance optimizations
